The file /kenya-clinical-challenge/data/train.csv is intended to contain the training dataset for the project. Since I do not have the actual content of the dataset, I will create a placeholder CSV structure that you can later populate with the actual data.

Here are the contents for the file:

Master_Index,Prompt,Clinician,County,Health level,Years of Experience,DDX SNOMED
1,What is the diagnosis for a patient with fever?,The patient may have malaria.,Nairobi,Hospital,5,123456
2,How to treat a patient with hypertension?,Consider prescribing antihypertensives.,Mombasa,Clinic,10,234567
3,What are the symptoms of diabetes?,Common symptoms include increased thirst and urination.,Kisumu,Health Center,3,345678
4,What is the follow-up for a patient with asthma?,Regular check-ups and inhaler use are recommended.,Nairobi,Hospital,8,456789
5,How to manage a patient with chronic pain?,Consider a multidisciplinary approach.,Mombasa,Clinic,12,567890

You can replace the placeholder data with the actual training data as needed.
